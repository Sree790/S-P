# Stock Price Analysis

In this project, we will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis on time series data of stock prices. The dataset contains historical stock prices of various companies, including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Netflix (NFLX). 

We will use Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore and visualize the data. The goal is to gain insights into the stock market trends, identify patterns, and make informed investment decisions.

The project will cover various aspects of stock price analysis, including data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis. We will explore techniques such as plotting time series data, calculating moving averages, resampling data to different time frequencies, and analyzing correlations between different stocks.
